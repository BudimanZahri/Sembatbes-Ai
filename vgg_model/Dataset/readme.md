## Model Selection
In this project, the algorithm chosen is VGG (Visual Geometry Group), which is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning architecture. VGG is known for its deep and structured structure, using multiple consecutive convolution layers with a small kernel size (3x3) which allows the recognition of complex visual features from images.
